                         DYNAMIC POWER PLAN TRAY
                            Quick Start Guide
================================================================================

WHAT THIS APP DOES
------------------
Automatically switches your Windows power plan and Lian Li fan speeds based on
CPU/GPU usage. When you're gaming or doing heavy work, it boosts performance.
When you're idle, it saves power.


FIRST TIME SETUP
----------------
1. Extract the ZIP to any folder (your Dropbox, Documents, wherever you like)

2. Double-click DynamicPowerPlan.exe

3. Click "Yes" on the Windows security prompt (admin rights are needed to
   change power plans)

4. Look for the new icon in your system tray (bottom-right of your screen)

5. That's it! The app is now running and monitoring your system.


SYSTEM TRAY MENU
----------------
Right-click the tray icon to see:

  - Current CPU and GPU usage percentages
  - Current mode (Boost or Normal)
  - Manual mode switches (High Performance / Everyday / Auto)
  - Start with Windows toggle
  - Open Config File
  - Exit


CONFIGURATION
-------------
Edit config.json (in the same folder as the exe) to customize:

  - Power plan names (must match your Windows power plans)
  - CPU/GPU thresholds (default: 70%)
  - Hold times before switching (prevents rapid toggling)
  - Games to watch (boost mode triggers when these are running)
  - L-Connect fan profile settings


POWER PLAN NAMES
----------------
By default, the app looks for power plans named:
  - "Everyday" (normal mode)
  - "High Performance" (boost mode)

To see your available power plans, open Command Prompt and run:
  powercfg /list

Then update the names in config.json to match.


FAN PROFILES (LIAN LI)
----------------------
The MB_on and MB_off folders contain L-Connect fan profiles:
  - MB_on = Full speed fans (used during boost)
  - MB_off = Normal fans (used during normal mode)

If you don't have Lian Li fans, set "enableFanBoost": false in config.json


GPU SUPPORT
-----------
The app automatically detects your GPU(s):
  - NVIDIA: Works out of the box with nvidia-smi
  - AMD: Install pyadl for best results (pip install pyadl)
  - Intel: Uses Windows Performance Counters

If you have multiple GPUs, the app uses the highest utilization.


LOGS
----
Check the logs folder for troubleshooting. The app logs:
  - Power plan changes
  - Fan profile changes
  - Any errors encountered
